            <h1>Documentation</h1>
            <h2>First Steps</h2>
            <h3>Analyze JavaScript coding</h3>
            <li>Make sure you have a folder which contains html files together with JavaScript code. You may for
                instance use git to replicate the source code of this application to a local folder.</li>
            <li>Open this application in a browser</li>
            <li>Choose in the menu File -> Extract Code from File System to SOMIX model (w/o .git). Choose the main
                folder of the application. All extracted components will be displayed in a circle.</li>
            <li>Choose in the menu FIle -> Open Work Folder. Specify a folder where the generation information for all
                diagrams shall be stored. In case you analyze this application choose the folder models.</li>
            <li>In case you use this application. Choose in the menu File -> Read Diagram. You will see a list of existing diagrams.</li>
            <li>In case there are no diagram informations yet. Choose in the menu File -> New Diagram. Enter a name for the diagram. 
                Choose Diagram -> Explore model to choose components to be displayed.</li>
            <h3>Demo</h3>
            It is possible to display and use demo data.
            Follow
            these steps:
            <li>Open the application in a Browser</li>
            <li>Choose in the menu Help -> Load demo data</li>
            <li>Do a right mouse click into the pane and choose "Start Force-directed graph". Wait some time and choose
                then "Stop Force-directed graph".</li>
            <li>Click on one of the red or blue circles with the right mouse button. Choose "Add element with all
                neighbors"</li>
            <li>Do a right mouse click into the pane and choose Demo Diagram</li>
            <li>Play around with left and right clicks of the mouse on elements, into boxes and onto the pane. Use also
                the scrool wheel of the mouse.</li>
            You may also choose Diagram -> Explore Model. Use this steps:
            <li>Open the application in a Browser</li>
            <li>Choose in the menu Help -> Load demo data</li>
            <li>Enter for instance ^Z.*LOG in the input field. This filters for all elements which start with Z and have
                a LOG
                somewhre in the name. You can use any Regex expression. The search is case insensitive.</li>
            <li>The Button Apply Filter may not yet work, instead move the mouse down.</li>
            <li>You can scroll with the mouse wheel in the result list.</li>
            <li>Make a right click on an element and choose "Add element with all neighbors"</li>
            <li>Choose cancel</li>
            <li>Make a right click in the pane and choose Demo Diagram.</li>
            <li>Play around with left and right clicks of the mouse on elements, into boxes and onto the pane. Use also
                the scrool wheel of the mouse.</li>

            <h3>Generate a SOMIX model from files in a local folder</h3>
            It is possible to analyze folders in the local file system:
            <li>Extract a model where files are date and folders are groupings. Choose File -> Extract File System to
                SOMIX
                model (w/o .git). A pop up opens where you specify a local folder on
                your computer.
                Content in .git folders is ignored. This is in most cases helfull when git is used. Git stores many
                files which
                are normally not of interest.</li>
            <li>Extract a model of the code in files. This is currently in development. Extract Code from File System to
                SOMIX
                model (w/o .git). A pop up opens where you specify a local folder on
                your computer.
                Content in .git folders is ignored. This is in most cases helfull when git is used. Git stores many
                files which
                are normally not of interest.</li>

            <h3>Use a SOMIX model</h3>
            When you have a SOMIX model (You will need to use SAP2Moose for now):
            <li>Choose File -> Load Model and load a SOMIX model</li>
            <li>Choose File -> Open Work Folder (Generation informations for files will be stored in this folder)</li>
            <li>Choose File -> New Diagram and enter a name for the new diagram.</li>
            <li>Make a right click into the pane and choose the name of your diagram. This will change the view and
                display:
                "This diagram is currentl empty: ..."</li>
            <li>Make a right mouse click into the pane and choose "Make this diagram active". When you later add
                elements to a
                diagram, these elements will be added to the active diagram.</li>
            <li>Now choose an element and add it to the active diagram like it was described on this page under "First
                Steps" ->
                "Demo".</li>
            <li>To save the displayed diagram choose File -> Save Displayed Diagram.</li>
            <li>When you repeat your work do <ul>
                    <li>Load a new SOMIX model. This will normally not be the model you used before. The diagram will be
                        automatically adapted to the new software version.</li>
                    <li>Choose File -> Open Work Folder</li>
                    <li>Choose File -> Read Diagram (You will need "Import old Diagram (XML) only when you worked with
                        the
                        Smalltalk version of Moose2Model).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Specify a workfolder first. These folder contains all diagrams which belong to the same
                            model
                        </li>
                        <li>Save the generation information for the displayed diagram. It be stored in a file with
                            extension
                            .m2m and similar name.</li>
                        <li>Read the generation information from an .m2m file. You should have all required model data
                            loaded
                            before. A diagram with identical name is created.</li>

                        <li>Please note that no warning is yet raised when information is lost due to wrong handling.
                        </li>

            <h3>Header</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Display the diagram which is displayed and which is active.</li>
                <li>Unsaved changes are marked with a bullet point behind the name of a diagram.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diagram with all elements</h3>
            A diagram with all elments is always displayed.
            It can be animated as a force-directed graph. This works well for small models.
            The main intention of this application is not to make force-directed graph, so other tools might work better
            here.
            <h3>Circuit Diagram for Software</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Code is displayed as orange box</li>
                <li>Data is displayed as blue circle</li>
                <li>Persistent data is displayed as green circle</li>
                <li>Groupings are indicated by a dashed box and include all elements contained in them</li>
                <li>Elements can be commented</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Planned Features</h2>
